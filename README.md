Hybrid CNN Model for Brain Tumor Detection

This project implements a hybrid deep learning model for brain tumor detection and classification using:
- A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Transfer Learning with ResNet50 and InceptionV3

The goal is to leverage the strengths of both custom feature extraction and pretrained networks to achieve high accuracy in identifying brain tumor types from MRI scans.

About

Brain tumors can be life-threatening if not detected early. This project builds a hybrid model combining:
- **Custom CNN layers** to capture unique features specific to the dataset
- **Pretrained models (ResNet50, InceptionV3)** to extract deep hierarchical features
- **Fusion** of extracted features for final classification

Tumor Types:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **No Tumor**

Model Architecture

- **Custom CNN**:  
  3‚Äì4 convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling  
- **ResNet50**:  
  Pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on MRI data  
- **InceptionV3**:  
  Pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on MRI data  
- **Feature Fusion**:  
  Features from CNN, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 are concatenated  
- **Fully Connected Layers**:  
  Dropout + Dense layers for classification

Dataset

You can use datasets such as:
- **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset** from Kaggle: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)
- The dataset should include MRI images categorized into **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, and **Normal**.

**Data Preprocessing**:
- Resize images to 224x224
- Normalize pixel values
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming)

Would you also like me to give you a simple version of the README if you want it a bit shorter for a first release? üöÄ  
Or maybe a badge-rich fancy version too? üéñÔ∏è
